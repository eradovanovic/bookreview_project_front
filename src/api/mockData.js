        review: "studio blockbusters are currently in the hands of like four white guys who are all exalted for having the exact same taste in comedy, and filling their movies with expository dialogue, montages, and coked-up pacing as to leave more room for that comedy. what if fights were interrupted by someone wanting to resolve it differently. what if we called out the thing that usually happens in these kinds of movies and maybe still do it anyway. what if a man enjoyed or fought to something that is usually for women or children.
